            <p>Given a target image, Dirty Triangles will evolve random polygons to match the target as closely as
                possible. At each step, a polygon is added, modified, or removed: a change is kept only if it makes the
                set of polygons look more like the target.</p>
            <p>Roger Johansson came up with the idea of evolving a picture from polygons, check out his article on <a
