            <p>Starting with a bunch of random polygons, Dirty Triangles will evolve a picture, like this view of
                the Taj Mahal. At each step, one of the polygons is randomly modified, or "mutated": this change is
                kept only if it makes the set of polygons look more like the target image, otherwise the mutation is
                discarded.</p>
